              I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were
              current, if not more so, in the company i joined. I honestly feel
              i got every penny's worth.

              "i was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've
              been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
              had an amazing ecperience here. I signed up for the free intro
              course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
              life. Since completing the course, i've successfully switched
              carears, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

              Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
              Getting guidance from them and learning from their experience was
              easy.

              junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the

              "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
              needed some structure from proffesionals who can help me learn
              programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
              program. The entire curriculum and staff did nit dissapoint. They
              were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance.
              The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
              learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
              have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
              example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land
              a job as a full-stack developer after recieving multiple offers.
              100% recommend!"
